Welcome! This app hosts your weekly **TidyTuesday** data explorations.
Use the sidebar to navigate to each week's analysis.

**Raison d'Ãªtre**:       
I've built this app because I wanted to familiarise myself with the Streamlit framework and its capabilities. 
I feel that TidyTuesday data is a great way to explore this, as it provides a wide range of datasets that can be used for various types of analyses and visualisations.

The focus of each week's exploration is to showcase how Streamlit could be used to maximise interactivity and visualisation of the data.
There is one dashboard for each week, which contains a variety of interactive widgets and visualisations that allow users to explore the data in different ways.
As such , each week's dashboard isn't designed to be an analysis itself, but rather to allow user to analyse the data through the use of interactive widgets and visualisations.
